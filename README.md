All the codes for 2023 USBR Water Supply Forecast Rodeo (details at https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/254/reclamation-water-supply-forecast-dev/page/797/)

The goal of each script is described at the beginning of the code script. 

As the test, need to put the data folder (which due to the data file size is not uploaded in this repo) as PRISM_USBE_forecast_Roder/Updated. Run four_features.py and fifteen_features.py which can do local validation generating the evaluation metrics (quantile loss and interval coverage). For the purpose of other scripts, check the top of the code.
